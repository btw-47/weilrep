# weilrep

[Sage](https://www.sagemath.org) code for computing with vector-valued modular forms, Jacobi forms and theta lifts.

# Installation

First enter `git clone https://github.com/btw-47/weilrep.git`

Then install by typing `sage --python weilrep/setup.py install --user`

You can also use this code in [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/) without installing Sage. Open a project and create a new folder named 'weilrep'. Copy all files from the /weilrep folder into the CoCalc project. Finally, navigate up (out of the 'weilrep' folder) and open a Sage worksheet in your home directory.

# How to use

After installing, open Sage and type

`from weilrep import *`

Please see the file `weilrep_readme.pdf` for an overview of the functions.
